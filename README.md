# ngx-source-obfuscation

Angular Builder CLI which integrates the javascript-obfuscation project into angular.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Package manager like yarn or npm
* Angular 8 or higher.

### Installing

#### Yarn
```
yarn add -D @russcarver/ngx-source-obfuscation
```

#### Npm
```
npm i -D @russcarver/ngx-source-obfuscation
```

#### Version Table
| Version | Angular |
|---------|:-------:|
| ^1.0.0  |    8    |
| ^2.0.0  |    9    |
| ^16.0.0 |   16    |
| ^17.0.0 |   17    |
| ^18.0.0 |   18    |
| ^19.0.0 |   19    |
| ^20.0.0 |   20    |

#### Angular Setup
Create a target in your `angular.json` file. Like the one shown bellow.
Other targets like `lint` or `build` are located in the same place.

*Important* make sure your levels of obfuscation and performance is suitable for your
project! The *default* parameters are most likely *not* what you *want*.

Example:
```json
{
  "obfuscate": {
    "builder": "@russcarver/ngx-source-obfuscation:obfuscate",
    "options": {
      "files": [
        {
          "fileExtensions": ["js"],
          "filePatternsToExclude": ["polyfills"],
          "input": "dist",
          "output": "."
        }
      ]
    },
    "configurations": {
      "production": {
        "debugProtection": true,
        "debugProtectionInterval": true,
        "sourceMap": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Files options
1. `fileExtensions` (required). This is an array of strings representing exact, case-insensitive file extensions of files you want to obfuscate.
1. `filePatternsToExclude` (optional). This is an array of case-insensitive strings representing strings, that if found anywhere in the filename or extension (or combined aka: a full name.ext), will be excluded from obfuscation.
1. `input` (required). This is the relative input path in which to search for files. It will search 30 nested directories deep from this path.
1. `output` (required). This is the relative output path from the `input` path in which to place the obfuscated results.

If the `output` path refers to the same directory as the `input` path, then files are obfuscated in-place (existing files are modified).
A Live Demo of the obfuscation library <https://obfuscator.io/> is provided by the author of the library.
A list of available configuration options can be found [here](https://github.com/javascript-obfuscator/javascript-obfuscator)

#### Running the task
##### General
The angular cli target can be invoked like every other target `<project>:<target>:<configuration>`.
##### Examples
###### Yarn
"Dev Build"
```
yarn ng run app:obfuscate
```

Prod Build
```
yarn ng run app:obfuscate:production
```

###### Npm
"Dev Build"
```
npx ng run app:obfuscate
```

Prod Build
```
npx ng run app:obfuscate:production
```

## Built With
